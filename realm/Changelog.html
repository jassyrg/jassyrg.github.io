            <p>Added Build Template Savers for Mercenary and Research builds.

            <p>Faction Coin base find chance increased to 10%, up from 2%.
            <p>Formula for FC rewards from excavations reworked.
            <p>Buildings no longer give assistants when you reach 100 of them. Instead, the first two building upgrades tiers for each category now give 1 assistant each (basically you get double the assistants, and earlier). Hall of Legends does not provide assistants this way (same as before).
            <p>Spell upgrade-related secret trophies (i.e. Fairy Choir, Hell Rush…) are now normal trophies, allowing players to know their requirements beforehand.
            <p>Nonexistent Ruler cost lowered to 10e153, down from 10e183.

            <p>Fixed countless typos and minor text issues.
            <p>In addition, we’d like to announce that Realm Grinder is going to be launched on mobile environment soon!
            <p>Once it is out, you will be able to play on all Android and iOS devices with the same Cloud account you use on Kongregate.
            <p>The new UI has been refit with that purpose in mind, but all purely web features such as tooltips and key bindings have been maintained. You may also switch from the new Upgrades view to the old one via the Switch Lists to Compact Style option in the Options menu without losing any functionalities.
            <p>Regarding development, this won’t change anything: both versions work on the same engine, so we won’t have double the work to do and there will be no risk of discontinued developing for the web platform.
            <p>Last but not least, we are already working on the next content update: Spell Upgrades! No ETA as of yet, but we’ll try our best to deliver it as soon as possible.
            <p><b>EDIT 1</b>
            <p>To all people disoriented by the new UI, here is a brief guide on how to take advantage of the new features or return to your old customs with the help of options.
            <p><b>Version 2.0.9.1</b>:
            <p>Fixed an issue with Mercenary Upgrades
            <p>BuyMAX button is no longer tutorial-locked and is available to view and change at all times.
            <p>There was an issue that could potentially caused performance lag which has now been fixed. Performance may have improved for people affected by that.

            <p>Fixed an issue with Challenges tutorial.
            <p>Compact List View is now on by default when you open the game, option has been inverted to allow switch to the extended view.

            <p>Fixed an issue with mercenary import.

            <p>Fixed Lightning Strike spell icon not appearing on Halls of Legends under certain conditions.
            <p>Also, update about lag issues: it seems that the problems mostly happens with Chrome browser, since we don’t see as much performance drop on Firefox. We will keep investigating and working on the specific reasons why it happens.
            <p><b>Version 2.0.10.1</b>:
            <p>Added colored backgrounds for alignment-based and faction-based elements.

            <p>More changes to in-game text to make it more easily readable.
            <p>Buy All Exchanges will give priority to upgrades, so it won’t fail to buy Heritages or other upgrades that cost FC.
            <p><b>Version 2.0.10.3</b>:
            <p>Fixed a bug that caused Coins Gained to be stuck at 0. Players with saves corrupted by this bug should now be able to continue playing.

            <p>S175 (Incantation), A25 (Delayed Reaction), E225 (Coercion) moved up 5 research points. This should solve template load issues with those researches.

            <p>Last but not least, the overhaul will also introduce a whole lot of quality of life features such as the Buy All upgrades buttom, Mercenary Template Save/Load, Research Template Save/Load, in-game tutorials and hints for beginners(veterans can skip them entirely at once) and more!

            <p>Faceless Bloodline reworked: now increases maximum mana based on mana produced in this game instead of its previous effect.
            <p>Dwarven Bloodline reworked: now increases the production of all buildings based on excavations made instead of its previous effect.
            <p>Berserking (W205) now has diminishing returns.

            <p>Lightning Strike's new formula was offset for high amounts of Iron Strongholds. We changed it so that it is now slightly more powerful for very low amounts of buildings, and stabilizing to the old value when you get more.
            <p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>
            <p><b>Easter Event</b>! It will start next week :) we'll make a dedicated post for it in a few days, explaining the dates and mechanics in full detail.
            <p>Also, there are some additional icon previews for the graphic overhaul! (see source post)
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.6.48.0</b> - Mar 6 2016
            <p><b>EXPANSION</b>: ASCENSIONS:
            <p>At Reincarnation 39, the Reincarnate button will turn into an Ascend button with the same requisites as Reincarnation 40. Clicking it will reset all the progress a Reincarnation would reset, but it will not reset your Reincarnation count, and then will revert back to the Reincarnate button for Reincarnation 41 with new requisites. By Ascending you will unlock a new main currency, Diamond Coins, that will be used for post-ascension upgrades and features, resulting in much smaller numbers. All upgrades that previously cost Gold Coins are now free, and the formulas for subsequent Reincarnations will change to allow continued progress. All Gifts bonuses, Scry Rewards, Ruby bonuses, Event bonuses and Gem bonuses will NOT be affected by the Ascension reduction.
            <p><b>NEW ARTIFACTS</b>: a couple artifacts were added at mid-range Reincarnation levels. They will also unlock upgrades that should help progress significantly during those stages of the game.
            <p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: two new secret trophies for your fun!
            <p>Challenges will now provide the fulfill requirement descriptions immediately. * We have decided this way since it is usually extremely difficult to figure out the requirements without a guide/forum/wiki, and since Challenges are now an important aspect of the game we don’t want players to skip them simply because they wouldn't know what to do.
            <p>Added a stat to track the activity time for each individual spell. Brainwave headstart from Faceless' Focused Thoughts Challenge is now calculated based on that stat rather than the amount of Brainwaves cast.
            <p>Autocast upgrades now also help while offline by increasing the Mana Produced and Spells cast statistics.
            <p>Offline production has been reviewed and tweaked to provide more consistent results.
            <p>Offline bonus shown in the production tooltip is now the full multiplier you get when you go offline. Previously, it was shown as 100% + multiplier.
            <p>Royal Exchanges and Excavations tooltips now show how many you have rather than the next one.
            <p>A lot of internal changes have been made to prevent tooltip inconsistencies. Several upgrades were also working incorrectly or were showing an incorrect tooltip - all of those have been fixed. All bonuses are now written as percentages rather than multipliers.
            <p><b>(Hotfix #1)</b>: Fixed minor graphic issues and Primal Balance not being affected by offline mana production.
            <p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>
            <p>As you all know, the next update in order is the Prestige Research Expansion part 1. It will include new researches for the Dwarven and Drow factions along with new upgrades, trophies and artifacts. The expansion is intended to start from Reincarnation 28 and carry players up to approximately Reincarnation 34.

            <p><b>1.5.42</b> - Dec 16 2015
            <p><b>EXPANSION</b>: SECRETS OF THE ANCIENTS
            <p><b>NEW RESEARCHES</b>: The Research system has been expanded to the Neutral factions: Titans, Druids and the Faceless. Starting from Reincarnation 23, excavate enough and follow the questline to discover the Secrets of the Realm and unlock Neutral Unique Buildings and more than 40 new researches for you to explore, unlock and customize your builds more than ever before!
            <p><b>EXCAVATIONS REVAMP</b>: Excavations now have their dedicated panel, no longer littering the upgrade list with their everlasting presence and allowing players to manage them better. In the new panel, you can now Multibuy excavations in the same way you do with buildings (you can activate the Excavation Warning option in the Options menu if you don't want to excavate too much); Reset your excavation progress manually at the cost of a few Rubies; and lastly you can check Excavations stats and logs and a list of the artifacts you discovered so far.
                <b>Note</b>: Rubies are only awarded the first time you reach specific Excavation thresholds - resetting excavations and reaching them again won't award more rubies.
            <p>
                <b>RUBY REVAMP</b>: You can now get rubies for free by excavating, and they now unlock upgrades and trophies as you accumulate them. They no longer give a fixed 2% bonus, but are instead tied to a new upgrade system. As a result, their bonus per money value has been increased significantly as Rubies now not only give a nifty bonus for accumulating them, but you can also spend them to fulfill your most urgent Realm Grinding needs such as assistants, mana regeneration and more. WARNING: rubies are no longer tied to your Kongregate account and will be reset upon Hard Resetting or importing from a different save. Rubies you purchased before this expansion will be available for transfer to a save of your choice.
            <p><b>NEW AUTOCAST UPGRADE</b>: Efficient Autocasting, which will allow you to select Independent Spells (bronze icon, set with CTRL+SHIFT+Clicking the spell) to work outside of contingency settings. These spells disregard your contingency rules and are casted as soon as you have enough mana for them.
            <p><b>NEW REINCARNATION POWER</b>: At Reincarnation 25, Reincarnation Power will increase Royal Exchange bonus by 0.5% per Reincarnation.
            <p><b>NEW UPGRADES</b>: new upgrade tiers for most of the already existing categories including but not limited to buildings and neutral production.

            <p>New Events panel to accomodate event-based feats and quests!
            <p>Fixed lots of tooltips.
            <p><b>Technical notes</b>:
            <p>Game performance improved.
            <p>With this expansion, we changed they way Cloud accounts are handled. If you did not Link your previous Cloud account to Kongregate, a new one will be automatically created and linked to Kongregate for you.

Upon reaching Reincarnation 16, each Vanilla faction (Fairies, Elves, Angels, Goblins, Undead, Demons) will start a questline to upgrade a particular building into a new more powerful one, which will be pivotal for the new mechanics involved in the expansion.

Each of the new upgrades has particular requisites to fulfill before you can unlock and purchase it - you will have to discover by yourself how to progress in the system.

            <p>ADDED TWO MORE AUTOCASTING UPGRADES:
            <p>Priority Autocasting allows you to prioritize casting of certain spells. Spells with a lower priority will not fire unless higher priority ones are already active.
            <p>Contingency Autocasting allows you to set a minimum amount of mana before firing spells, then it checks for priorities. If you have an instant cast spell in the queue, it will be cast until you deplete your mana, at which point the contingency ends.

            <p>Added an additional tier for building upgrades.
            <p>The building upgrade series for Farm, Inn, and Blacksmith has been rebalanced: now scales up to +500%, then decreases down to 100%. The final result is still higher than the current value, and much higher than other buildings.

This was unintended, therefore the nerf was reverted and the formula was fixed. Territorial Expanse chance should now have a significantly greater diminishing return for higher amounts of Labyrinths (more than ~450) while having a significantly higher chance below that value.
            <p>We fixed an issue with Grand Balance which caused the spell to miscalculate the building it should have empowered. Now it should always empower the building types which contributes less to your total income.

            <p><b>1.1.16</b> - Jun 26th, 2015

            <p>The upgrade tab has been improved: there is now a button to Show/Hide purchased upgrades, and an option in the Options tab to sort them by price instead of their default order. The overall performance of the upgrade tab should have increased dramatically.

            <p>Added visuals for Assistants! A small, flying, faction-themed dot will be stationing beside the treasure as soon as you have at least one assistant, providing a useful tooltip when you hover it. If you wish to disable assistant graphics, there is a new checkbox in the Options tab.
            <p>Grinding Dedication now remains unlocked and available to purchase through soft resets.
            <p>Added an option to disable Trophy Popups.
            <p>Fixed an issue that could lead to a crash and grey screen.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.8</b> - May 27th, 2015
            <p>Added performance options to the Options tab: click on the switch at the top to change from Save to Options page. This will help users having performance issues, we plan to add more GUI customization options in the future like scientific notation for numbers, so look forward to them!
            <p>Fixed a bug in the demon upgrade Demonic Presence which caused Hell Portals to produce less than they were supposed to. Lazy demons were punished and are now working as intended.
            <p>Spell tooltips were not updating correctly when buying Angelic Dominance. They should now display the correct data. This has no effect on game mechanics, it was only a tooltip issue.
            <p>Hellfire Blast's bonus per trophy ratio has been increased significantly.
            <p>Night Time has been reworked. Now increases Assistant production by 50% per Necropolis you own for 20 seconds. This should make the spell much more useful in the end game at the expense of the early game.
            <p>We changed the way saves are handled. Hopefully this should help users with save issues, please let us know if it works!
            <p>Added a line in the mana bar tooltip and stats to clarify the Autocast effect.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.7</b> - May 25th, 2015
            <p>Reverted some changes to underlying libraries we did in the last update. This should solve the crash issue some players were experiencing. Sorry about the inconvenience.
            <p>Hotfixed a small issue with some upgrades not showing after a save was imported.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.6</b> - May 25th, 2015
            <p>Added thousand separator to numbers.
            <p>Farm, Inn, and Blacksmith upgrade series reworked: now upgrades are scaling from 100% to 400%. This should slightly level the difference between building tiers and give a significant boost to the Fairy faction. Fairy upgrades were toned down a bit due to this change, but the final result is still way higher than before.
            <p>Goblin's Strong Currency was still too high of a boost compared to all other factions, therefore its high-end scaling was toned down a bit more, while its starting boost is roughly the same.
            <p>Undead's Night Time spell has been buffed to have more impact on lower tier buildings.
            <p>Hall of Legends upgrade series was bugged and has been reworked. Now non-Hall of Legends buildings production should be more consistent and, in most cases, higher.
            <p>Added a warning to the manual save that will tell you if the game was unable to save your game. If that happens, follow the on-screen instructions.
            <p>This update should also help with the grey screen issue some users are having, let us know your specs if it happens again.
            <p>Change Ctrl to Command in tooltips for Mac users.
            <p>Added one more confirmation to hard reset in order to prevent accidental resets.
            <p>Fixed a typo in the 500 gems Trophy.
            <p>Fixed, reworded, and added several other tooltips for clarity. Can't get enough of these ;)
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.5</b> - May 23rd, 2015
            <p>ADDED IMPORT/EXPORT SAVE. Press the Export Save button in the Options tab to copy a string code to clipboard, then paste it in a text file or directly into the Import textbox.
            <p>Added tooltip info for buy10 and buy100. Hover on building and royal exchange buttons to see it.
            <p>Added tooltip info for Faction Coin chance. Hover on faction coins in lower left corner to see it.
            <p>Mana regen upgrades and the Autocast upgrade are now unlocked by mana spent instead of spells cast, and they remain unlocked through soft resets.
            <p>Mouse upgrades that provided a fixed bonus to clicking reward now remain unlocked through soft resets.
            <p>Goblin's "Strong Currency" upgrade has been significantly toned down.
            <p>Gem's ability to increase the chance of finding faction coins is now capped at 25%. Elves can still achieve 100% chance due to their faction upgrades.
            <p>Reworded several tooltips for clarity.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.4</b> - May 22nd, 2015
            <p>OFFLINE PRODUCTION IS NOW OPERATIVE!
            <p>Added SHIFT+Click to buy 100. This and CTRL+Click now also work on Faction Exchanges.
            <p>Improved auto-save performance.
            <p>Fixed Demonic Presence tooltip.
            <p>Fixed criteries for secret achievements not unlocking correctly.
            <p>Fixed a bug with Holy Light that caused the game to crash in rare cases.
            <p>Fixed a bug that caused Tireless Workers not to show its bonus correctly in the Stats tab. The upgrade has always worked, but the stats didn't update to reflect it properly.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.3</b> - May 21st, 2015
            <p>Hellfire Blast reworked. Now increases your Evil Fortresses and Hell Portals production based on your amount of trophies for 20 seconds.
            <p>Plagued Buildings and Epidemic Buildings reworked: Now increase overall production by 2% per hour of playtime in the current session.
            <p>Added coins needed for the next gem in the Gem tooltip.
            <p>Fixed a bug that caused some upgrades to kill your assistants if you didn't have enough building to support them. They should be safe from the evil bugs now.
            <p>Reworded and fixed several tooltips for clarity.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.2</b> - May 20th, 2015
            <p>More optimization, lag should be reduced.
            <p>Fixed a bug that caused Royal Exchanges upgrades to be unavailable despite owning the correct amount of faction coins.
            <p>Fixed some typos and minor graphics bugs.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.1</b> - May 20th, 2015
            <p>Mana cap reduced to 1000 and reworked the Autocast feature due to balance issues.
            <p>Optimization to fix some lag issues. We are still working to improve game performance, but as of now, it should be a lot better than before.
            <p>Added progress text to trophies.
            <p>Clarified wording on some Upgrades and Trophies.
            <p>Added/Edited tooltips to Faction Coins, Gems, and Assistants for clarity.
            <p>Fixed autosave issues that caused some clients not to save correctly.
